# brat_gamification_nodata
very basic interface design for gamifying the use of the brat annotation software (https://github.com/nlplab/brat)

To research various mechanics of gamification, I created and tested a simple GUI/Overview of various benchmarks that users using the brat
rapid annotation software (https://github.com/nlplab/brat) could use to show their annotation progress. 
Unfortunately, as the project was done in the scope of a thesis project I can not upload the data that I used for testing, but I can put
screenshots of what the interface looked like. 
If you are interested in the project, you can read my paper at http://essay.utwente.nl/74616/ . 
The project is not scalable and will not be further developed, as it has served its purpose. 
Special thanks to Mariet Theune ( http://wwwhome.cs.utwente.nl/~theune/ ) from the Human Media Interaction department at the University
of Twente ( https://www.utwente.nl/en/eemcs/hmi/ ) and Dolf Trieschnigg from MyDataFactory ( https://www.mydatafactory.com/ ) in 
suporting and guiding me through my work.
